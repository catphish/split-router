Not much documentation to speak of yet. Configure [local] and a remote.

Start the app as root, bring the network interface and add the system routes.

You will need balanced routes through tun0, and you will need to specify external routes to ensure each remote goes through the appropriate connection eg:

* ip route add 198.51.100.1 dev ppp0
* ip route add 198.51.100.2 dev ppp1
* nohup ./split_router &
* ip link set tun0 up
* ip route add 203.0.113.0/24 dev tun0
